## Description
"next_laravel_dev_with_docker" is a repository that configures a local development environment to seamlessly integrate NEXT JS and Laravel. By setting up this environment, accessing http://localhost/ opens a NEXT JS page, while http://localhost/server/ leads to a Laravel page. This setup facilitates easy development and testing for projects combining the power of NEXT JS for the frontend and Laravel for the backend, all within a Dockerized environment for consistency across different machines.
